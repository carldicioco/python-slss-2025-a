# Create our own Chatbot

# 1. Greet the user with a predetermined statement
greeting = "hello! I am a chatbot."

# 2. Print the statement
print(greeting)

#3. Introduce the bot
print("My name is MeGPT.")
print("I'm not like other chatbots.")
print("I'm completely deterministic.")

# 3. Wow the user with some maths

print("I bet you don't know what 8*8 is.")
print("I can do it.")
print(f"8*8 is actually {8*8}.")

print("What is pi squared")
print("I'm smart and can do it.")
print(f"It is {3.141592653 ** 2}.")

#4. Get the nname of the user and store it
user_name = input("So..... what's your name?")
print(f"It's nice to meet you, {user_name}.")

movie = input("What is your favorite movie?")
print(f"Oh {movie}! I like that too!")

subject = input("What is your favourite school subject?")
print(f"{subject} is a good subject too!")

sport = input("What is your favourite sport?")
print(f"Oh cool! {sport} are one of my favourites as well!")

favourite_book = input("What's your favourite book? ")
print("Processing your answer...")
print(f"Nice choice! '{favourite_book}' sounds like an interesting read. ⭐️")

print(f"Goodbye {user_name}!")
